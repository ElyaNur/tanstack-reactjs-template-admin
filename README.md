# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tanstack Router + React Query

This is a personal template that i use to start new projects with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tanstack Router, React Query
and some other tools.

this template is based on the [Vite React Template](http://github.com/vitejs/create-vite) and
the [Vite TypeScript Template](http://github.com/vitejs/create-vite).

## Notes

This is just a frontend template, you can use it with any backend you want.

if you want to use this template with a backend, you can use my backend template using nestjs +
typescript [here](https://github.com/ElyaNur/nestjs-admin-template)
